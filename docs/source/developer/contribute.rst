Get your environment setup
--------------------------

*Operating system*

SpyDrNet is written in pure python 3 and we welcome contributers using any operating system as a development platform. As of the release of version 1.4 all of the contributors have used Windows (10) or Linux (Ubuntu) for their contributions. However we have no reason to believe any other opterating system that supports python 3.5 and greater would present a problem. If it does maybe you could help us solve it!

*The Python Interpreter*

SpyDrNet is tested on Python 3.5 and up. We suggest that one of the tested version of Python 3 be used to develop with SpyDrNet, perferably the latest stable release. These are the supported platforms for release and it makes the most sense for the developers to run the release platforms.

Pip is a useful tool for installing python packages. It is useful to help install needed packages for the tests and building the documentation. Not all developers have experience with python. Useful information about installing and using pyhton as well as language documentation can be found at https://docs.python.org/3/ . This, is a great reference for getting aquainted with pyhton.

*Code Editing*

There are some great code editors. Do a google search, find one you like and use it. It doesn't much matter what you use as long as it gets the job done.
