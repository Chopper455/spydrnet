SpyDrNet was first conceived by Andrew Keller, Dr. Michael Wirthlin, and a few
additional students. They envisioned a next generation tool for the analysis and
transformation of netlists in many different formats for many different 
applications. The tool follows its predecessor, BYU EDIF Tools. Many persons,
organizations, grants, and other entities have contributed (or currently
contribute) to the development, documentation, improvement, and design of
SpyDrNet.
